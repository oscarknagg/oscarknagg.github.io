I'm currently employed at [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/), a popular language learning app. 
I've built many things there, 
the most interesting of which is a phonetic speech recognition system that transcribes user's speech into 
[IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) symbols so they can receive detailed
feedback on their pronunciation. The model utilises [unsupervised learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11477.pdf)
to squeeze the most performance out of the relatively [small dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMIT) available
on this problem.

Before that I built a model to classify URLs into phishing/safe at [Wandera](https://www.wandera.com/) and earlier
still I studied physics at University College London.

There are many fields of machine learning that I'd love to work with in a professional capacity:
* Reinforcement learning
* Unsupervised learning (especially in combination with the above)
* Speech recognition/speaker identification
* Creative/generative models
